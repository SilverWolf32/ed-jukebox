# ED iTunes Controller

A companion app for Elite: Dangerous that makes your favorite iTunes playlist responsive to in-game events.

## Status

Nothing works yet.

## How it works

Elite writes game events to a "journal" file as they happen, which is used by third-party tools such as [ED-VOID][ed-void] and [EDMC][edmc]. This app uses the `Music` journal event to decide which tracks to play from iTunes.

## Credits

This app uses code from [ED-VOID](https://ed-void.com), an exploration and racing tool.
